# White-Hat-vs-Black-Hat-Visualization
DS4200 Information Visualization Final Project

# Description
This project examines how the relationship between educational attainment and median household income varies both across and within major U.S. cities. While education is often linked to higher income, the strength and shape of this relationship can differ depending on local economic, demographic, and historical contexts. The guiding research question for this analysis was: How does the relationship between educational attainment and income vary across and within U.S. cities? To explore this, I created two interactive visualizations: a “white hat” visualization, designed to present the data ethically and transparently, and a “black hat” visualization, which intentionally distorts the framing to promote a misleading conclusion while still using technically accurate data. Comparing these two visualizations reveals not only patterns in the underlying data, but also the ethical and rhetorical consequences of design choices in data storytelling.

# Design Choices
The dataset for this project comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates, providing census tract-level demographic, education, and income data for five major cities: New York, Washington, Oakland, Atlanta, and Baltimore. Key variables included the number of residents aged 25 or older with a bachelor’s degree or higher, the total population aged 25 and over, and median household income adjusted for inflation. Geographic context was provided by the city variable and census tract identifier (GEOID), while demographic context came from race and ethnicity data for major racial groups. Data preprocessing involved calculating the percentage of college-educated residents in each tract, converting median income to numeric values, masking invalid or negative entries, and computing race and ethnicity percentages. I included Hispanic or Latino ethnicity despite it not being classified as a race because it provided important context for disparities, though this meant some individuals were double counted. Records missing key values were removed to ensure accuracy. The tract-level granularity of the dataset made it well-suited to examining both cross-city and within-city variation, revealing neighborhood-level differences that challenge simplified assumptions about the education–income relationship. Notably, I observed that even among tracts with similar education levels, predominantly white neighborhoods often had higher incomes than predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods.

# How to View the Visualization
Download the Jupyter Notebook files to explore the visualizations. The white hat visualization allows users to select a major city from a dropdown menu. When a census tract is clicked, it is highlighted with a black outline to clearly indicate the selected area, and a pie chart appears on the left displaying the tract’s racial breakdown.

The black hat visualization also includes a city-selection dropdown but adds a quadratic regression line, subtly guiding the viewer toward perceiving a flatter relationship between education and income. Both visualizations feature zoom functionality, dropdown filters, and use the IBM color palette to ensure the colors remain clear and accessible for viewers.
